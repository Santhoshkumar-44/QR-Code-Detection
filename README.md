# QR-Code-Detection
-Custom trained deep learning to model to detect QR codes within an image frame. 
-The model can be integrated with yolov5 and further versions too. 
-The majority of the dataset was collected from my friends and the remaining was collected from various sources such as roboflow universe and kaggle datasets. 
-The dataset consists of three parts - Static, Dynamic and Empty. Static images are images of QR Codes that are directly generated. Dynamic images are the images of the QR Codes taken in real under various lighting conditions and multiple angles. Empty images are the images without any QR Code which helps the model differentiate between QR images and empty images.
